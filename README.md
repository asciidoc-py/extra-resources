# extra-resources
Extra resources that are not contained within the primary asciidoc-py repo.

Right now, it is mostly a dumping ground of plugins / languages where their
licenses are not GPLv2+ compatible and so cannot live in asciidoc-py itself.
This repo itself does not currently have a license, but the plugins / languages
should all have a license included in the folder or header of the respective file.

See https://asciidoc-py.github.io/manpage.html#X1 for details on how you might
install one of these resources.
